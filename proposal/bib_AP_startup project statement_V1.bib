However, the literature on urban tourism has mostly neglected the influence of perceived spatial agglomeration effects on hotel location choice, especially in the developing countries. The study assessed the influence of perceived spatial agglomeration effects in determining hotel location in the Kumasi Metropolis of Ghana. Data were collected from hotel owners in the Metropolis and analysed with the χ2 test of independence and binary logistic regression. Four main perceived spatial agglomeration effects were found to significantly determine hotel location in the Metropolis.},

  abstract = {In this paper Australian domestic and international inbound travel are modelled by an anisotropic dynamic spatial lag panel Origin-Destination (OD) travel flow model. Spatial OD travel flow models have traditionally been applied in a single cross-sectional context, where the spatial structure is assumed to have reached its long run equilibrium and temporal dynamics are not explicitly considered. On the other hand, spatial effects are rarely accounted for in traditional tourism demand modelling. We attempt to address this dichotomy between spatial modelling and time series modelling in tourism research by using a spatial-temporal model. In particular, tourism behaviour is modelled as travel flows between regions. Temporal dependencies are accounted for via the inclusion of autoregressive components, while spatial autocorrelations are explicitly accounted for at both the origin and the destination. We allow the strength of spatial autocorrelation to exhibit seasonal variations, and we allow for the possibility of asymmetry between capital-city neighbours and non-capital-city neighbours. Significant temporal and spatial dynamics have been uncovered for both domestic and international tourism demand. For example we find strong seasonal temporal autocorrelations, significant trends and significant spatial autocorrelations at both the origin and the destination. Moreover, the spatial patterns are found to be most significant during peak holiday seasons. Understanding these patterns in tourist behaviour has important implications for tourism operators.},

This paper explores the spatial effects of port development on regional economic openness for a sample of 43 cities located in Bohai Rim region. We measure the opening level of cities through 8 indicators via G1-Entropy method from the perspective of economic base and the degree of opening, then use spatial correlation test to demonstrate spatial dependence and heterogeneity among cities. Based on the above result, we utilize one-regime spatial Durbin model to investigate the direct and indirect effect of port development on economic openness and two-regime spatial Durbin model to take the gradient of openness spillover into consideration. This paper is featured with three innovative points:Firstly, the analysis of spatial spillover effect of port development on economic openness enriches the current port-city relation research; secondly, the discussion of spatial dependence and spillover overcomes the disadvantage of isolating the research object geographically; thirdly, the application of two-regime spatial Durbin model explains the difference of spillover effect. Results suggest that economic openness is influenced by both local and neighboring ports. Furthermore, the spatial spillover effects are significant among 43 cities. We also find that the overall openness spillover effect of Bohai Rim falls into the mutual benefit development type while Liaoning province belongs to independency type, and role model type for Shandong province. Hebei-Tianjin subgroup falls into the type featured by being the weak when encountering the strong, and being the strong when encountering the weak.},

Combining forecasts can improve the accuracy of forecasting the demand for tourism, but limited work has been devoted to developing such combinations. This article addresses two significant issues in this context. First, the linear combination is the commonly used method of combining tourism forecasts. However, additive techniques unreasonably ignore interactions among the inputs. Second, the available data often do not adhere to specific statistical assumptions. Grey prediction has thus drawn attention because it does not require that the data follow any statistical distribution. This study proposes a nonadditive combination method by using the fuzzy integral to integrate single-model forecasts obtained from individual grey prediction models. Using China and Taiwan tourism demand as empirical cases, the results show that the proposed method outperforms the other combined methods considered here.},

Visitor flow spillovers from neighbouring attractions are found to have significant effects on attraction demand. The intensity and direction of visitor flows’ spillover effects vary by attraction locations. Furthermore, asymmetric spillover effects of visitor flows between a pair of attractions have been identified for the first time in the tourism literature. The adoption of novel spatial estimation methods generates a new dimension to investigate intra-destination demand across attractions. This can provide empirical evidence for decision-makers to optimise visitor flows within a destination.},

The pooled OLS model demonstrates much worse forecasting performance than the other models. This indicates the huge heterogeneity of tourism across cities in China. A marked improvement with the inclusion of fixed effects suggests that destination features that stay the same or vary very little over time can explain most of the heterogeneity. Adding spatial effects to the panel data models also increases forecasting accuracy, although the improvement is small. The spatial distribution of spillover effects is drawn on a map and a spatial pattern is recognized.

This paper reports results from an econometric study of tourism flows for the 107 Italian provinces based on origin–destination (OD) spatial interaction models. In addition to distance, the set of explanatory variables includes both pull and push characteristics to assess their relative roles in determining the attractiveness of the provinces to tourists. Hence measures are incorporated for income, density, accessibility, and natural, cultural and recreational attractions. The main results indicate the importance of spatial dependency induced by neighbouring provinces as both origins of, and destinations for trips, a factor commonly overlooked by previous contributions relying on the gravity specification. Inter-neighbouring interactive effects are thus important, and most explanatory variables exhibit the expected effect, with distance and population density showing a negative impact on tourists' decisions when choosing a specific destination, while income, accessibility and attractions are crucial determinants of tourism flows.},

  abstract = {This paper presents an approach to regional development policy that may serve to stimulate the growth of tourism-based industries. The context for this discussion lies in the experiences of Australia's rural towns, but the applications seem broadly international. The paper explains the concepts of clustering in a model for micro-markets that is consistent with the global demands for competition. The focus is on the creation of economic and social opportunity in small communities through the development of clusters of complementary firms that can collectively deliver a bundle of attributes to make up a specialized regional product. Micro-market clustering theory offers one alternative for enhancing regional economic growth, but it seems suited to tourism development when the regional product requires a combination of many services to deliver the single experience the tourist seeks.},

By reviewing 195 studies published during the period 1961?2011, the meta-regression analysis shows that origin, destination, time period, modeling method, data frequency, the inclusion/omission of other explanatory variables and their measures, and sample size all significantly influence the estimates of the demand elasticities generated by a model. Moreover, the demand elasticities at both product and destination levels are generalized by statistically integrating previous empirical estimates. The findings of this meta-analysis will be useful wherever an understanding of the drivers of tourism demand is critically important.},

  abstract = {For the past two decades, Michael Porter's work has towered over the field of competitive strategy.~On Competition, Updated and Expanded Edition brings together more than a dozen of Porter's landmark articles from the Harvard Business Review. Five are new to this edition, including the 2008 update to his classic "The Five Competitive Forces That Shape Strategy," as well as new work on health care, philanthropy, corporate social responsibility, and CEO leadership. This collection captures Porter's unique ability to bridge theory and practice. Each of the articles has not only shaped thinking, but also redefined the work of practitioners in its respective field. In an insightful new introduction, Porter relates each article to the whole of his thinking about competition and value creation, and traces how that thinking has deepened over time.This collection is organized by topic, allowing the reader easy access to the wide range of Porter's work.~Parts I and II present the frameworks for which Porter is best known—frameworks that address how companies, as well as nations and regions, gain and sustain competitive advantage.~Part III shows how strategic thinking can address society's most pressing challenges, from environmental sustainability to improving health-care delivery.~Part IV explores how both nonprofits and corporations can create value for society more effectively by applying strategy principles to philanthropy.~Part V explores the link between strategy and leadership.},

The key findings, drawn from comparisons of method-performance profiles over time, are that forecasting models have grown more diversified, that these models have been combined, and that the accuracy of forecasting has been improved. Given the complexity of determining tourism demand, there is no single method that performs well for all situations, and the evolution of forecasting methods is still ongoing. This article also launches the Annals of Tourism Research Curated Collection on tourism demand forecasting, which contains past and hot off the press work on the topic and will continue to grow as new articles on the topic appear in Annals.},

  abstract = {Intergovernmental strategic interaction has been a particular focus of research on public economics. In China, the industrial land conveyance has gradually replaced fiscal, taxation, and population policies, and has become one of the most intense fields concerning the interaction between local governments. Based on panel data collected from 275 cities between 2007 and 2015, the researchers have constructed an asymmetric two-regime Spatial Durbin Model and conducted in-depth research into the strategic interaction between local governments in industrial land conveyance, from both regional and industry perspectives. The results show that industrial land conveyance in China’s different regions and industries demonstrate diversified interactive forms, as opposed to being limited to the ‘race-to-the-bottom’ form as is generally accepted by previous research. From a regional perspective, the nationwide data results show that the strategic interaction of local governments’ industrial land conveyance behaviors is featured by ‘strengthening intervention with a complete race-to-the-bottom strategy’. The authors then divided the data into three regional categories of eastern, central, and western, with the results showing that local governments compete to intervene in industrial land conveyance, and the degree of competitive intervention strengthens from east to west, with the eastern region being characterized by ‘no strategy’, the central region ‘strengthening intervention with a strengthening strategy when neighboring cities take a weakening strategy’, and the western region ‘strengthening intervention with a complete race-to-the-bottom strategy’. From an industrial perspective, compared with labor-intensive and technology-intensive industries that have an interactive form of ‘strengthening intervention with a follow-up strengthening strategy’, local governments’ competition to intervene in the industrial land conveyance is far fiercer in capital-intensive industries which have an interactive form of ‘strengthening intervention with a complete race-to-the-bottom strategy’.},

  abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to review recent studies published from 2007 to 2015 on tourism and hotel demand modeling and forecasting with a view to identifying the emerging topics and methods studied and to pointing future research directions in the field. Design/methodology/approach Articles on tourism and hotel demand modeling and forecasting published mostly in both science citation index and social sciences citation index journals were identified and analyzed. Findings This review finds that the studies focused on hotel demand are relatively less than those on tourism demand. It is also observed that more and more studies have moved away from the aggregate tourism demand analysis, whereas disaggregate markets and niche products have attracted increasing attention. Some studies have gone beyond neoclassical economic theory to seek additional explanations of the dynamics of tourism and hotel demand, such as environmental factors, tourist online behavior and consumer confidence indicators, among others. More sophisticated techniques such as nonlinear smooth transition regression, mixed-frequency modeling technique and nonparametric singular spectrum analysis have also been introduced to this research area. Research limitations/implications The main limitation of this review is that the articles included in this study only cover the English literature. Future review of this kind should also include articles published in other languages. The review provides a useful guide for researchers who are interested in future research on tourism and hotel demand modeling and forecasting. Practical implications This review provides important suggestions and recommendations for improving the efficiency of tourism and hospitality management practices. Originality/value The value of this review is that it identifies the current trends in tourism and hotel demand modeling and forecasting research and points out future research directions.},

  abstract = {The main purpose of this research is to investigate and estimate the spillover effects in inbound and domestic tourism flows to 341 cities in mainland China. In conjunction with this, the key determinants of tourism flows are also studied in the spatial econometric model. The results confirm the existence of spillover effects in both inbound and domestic tourism flows, and suggest that physical infrastructure factors, tourist attractions, and the SARS outbreak are significant determinants of inbound and domestic tourism flows. In addition, it is found that although the degree of openness to inbound tourists is important for inbound tourism flows, a city?s income is the key to enhancing domestic tourism flows. Significant differences in spillover effects and determinants of tourism flows are also discovered between cities in different regions.},

A spatial growth regression framework is used to model the growth in regional tourism and identify the economic and spatial factors that explain the variability in tourism growth across 342 prefectural-level cities in China from 2002 to 2010. The analysis identifies several important factors, including local economic growth, localization economies, tourism resource endowments, and hotel infrastructure, as well as spatial spill-over effects and cross-city competition effects associated with tourism resource endowments and hotel infrastructure. A geographically weighted spatial Durbin model is then used to account for spatial heterogeneity in tourism growth patterns, and localized patterns of tourism growth are identified.},
