  abstract = {Spatial agglomeration is a firm behaviour and mostly occurs because of competition among firms to enjoy spatial agglomeration effects and have the tendency to influence hotel location choice. However, the literature on urban tourism has mostly neglected the influence of perceived spatial agglomeration effects on hotel location choice, especially in the developing countries. The study assessed the influence of perceived spatial agglomeration effects in determining hotel location in the Kumasi Metropolis of Ghana. Data were collected from hotel owners in the Metropolis and analysed with the χ2 test of independence and binary logistic regression. Four main perceived spatial agglomeration effects were found to significantly determine hotel location in the Metropolis.},

It is an effective way to determine preferences and assess the tradeoffs that individuals make in considering various product and services bundles. Discrete choice analysis deals with qualitative choice behaviour on discrete choice situations. In travel and tourism research, random utility models have received considerable academic and industry attention and become a well-established framework. These models relate to discrete choice behaviour and permit structural analyses of demand at the level of individual decision. This approach exploits the theoretical infrastructure of utility maximization and heterogeneity in decision-makers and choice alternatives. Applied to travel research, discrete choice analysis refers to travel mode choices that differ in their attributes such as cost, comfort, safety, and travel time. This paper focuses on the application of analysis of travel and tourism demand.},

In tourism research, complexity is a subject of growing interest and researchers start to analyse the tourism system as a complex phenomenon. However, there is little application of ABMs as a tool to explore and predict tourism patterns. The purpose of the paper is to develop an ABM that increases knowledge in tourism research by (i) considering the complexity of tourism phenomenon, (ii) providing tools to explore the complex relations between system components and (iii) giving insights on the functioning of the system and the tourist decision-making process. A theoretical ABM is developed to improve knowledge on tourist decision-making in the selection of a destination to vacation. Tourists’ behaviour, such as individual motivation, and social network influence in the vacation decision-making process are hereby discussed.},

  abstract = {In this paper Australian domestic and international inbound travel are modelled by an anisotropic dynamic spatial lag panel Origin-Destination (OD) travel flow model. Spatial OD travel flow models have traditionally been applied in a single cross-sectional context, where the spatial structure is assumed to have reached its long run equilibrium and temporal dynamics are not explicitly considered. On the other hand, spatial effects are rarely accounted for in traditional tourism demand modelling. We attempt to address this dichotomy between spatial modelling and time series modelling in tourism research by using a spatial-temporal model. In particular, tourism behaviour is modelled as travel flows between regions. Temporal dependencies are accounted for via the inclusion of autoregressive components, while spatial autocorrelations are explicitly accounted for at both the origin and the destination. We allow the strength of spatial autocorrelation to exhibit seasonal variations, and we allow for the possibility of asymmetry between capital-city neighbours and non-capital-city neighbours. Significant temporal and spatial dynamics have been uncovered for both domestic and international tourism demand. For example we find strong seasonal temporal autocorrelations, significant trends and significant spatial autocorrelations at both the origin and the destination. Moreover, the spatial patterns are found to be most significant during peak holiday seasons. Understanding these patterns in tourist behaviour has important implications for tourism operators.},

This paper explores the spatial effects of port development on regional economic openness for a sample of 43 cities located in Bohai Rim region. We measure the opening level of cities through 8 indicators via G1-Entropy method from the perspective of economic base and the degree of opening, then use spatial correlation test to demonstrate spatial dependence and heterogeneity among cities. Based on the above result, we utilize one-regime spatial Durbin model to investigate the direct and indirect effect of port development on economic openness and two-regime spatial Durbin model to take the gradient of openness spillover into consideration. This paper is featured with three innovative points:Firstly, the analysis of spatial spillover effect of port development on economic openness enriches the current port-city relation research; secondly, the discussion of spatial dependence and spillover overcomes the disadvantage of isolating the research object geographically; thirdly, the application of two-regime spatial Durbin model explains the difference of spillover effect. Results suggest that economic openness is influenced by both local and neighboring ports. Furthermore, the spatial spillover effects are significant among 43 cities. We also find that the overall openness spillover effect of Bohai Rim falls into the mutual benefit development type while Liaoning province belongs to independency type, and role model type for Shandong province. Hebei-Tianjin subgroup falls into the type featured by being the weak when encountering the strong, and being the strong when encountering the weak.},

Combining forecasts can improve the accuracy of forecasting the demand for tourism, but limited work has been devoted to developing such combinations. This article addresses two significant issues in this context. First, the linear combination is the commonly used method of combining tourism forecasts. However, additive techniques unreasonably ignore interactions among the inputs. Second, the available data often do not adhere to specific statistical assumptions. Grey prediction has thus drawn attention because it does not require that the data follow any statistical distribution. This study proposes a nonadditive combination method by using the fuzzy integral to integrate single-model forecasts obtained from individual grey prediction models. Using China and Taiwan tourism demand as empirical cases, the results show that the proposed method outperforms the other combined methods considered here.},

AI models are rapidly developed in the past decade and hybrid AI models are becoming a new trend.

  abstract = {This paper presents a critique of expected utility theory as a descriptive model of decision making under risk, and develops an alternative model, called prospect theory. Choices among risky prospects exhibit several pervasive effects that are inconsistent with the basic tenets of utility theory. In particular, people underweight outcomes that are merely probable in comparison with outcomes that are obtained with certainty. This tendency, called the certainty effect, contributes to risk aversion in choices involving sure gains and to risk seeking in choices involving sure losses. In addition, people generally discard components that are shared by all prospects under consideration. This tendency, called the isolation effect, leads to inconsistent preferences when the same choice is presented in different forms. An alternative theory of choice is developed, in which value is assigned to gains and losses rather than to final assets and in which probabilities are replaced by decision weights. The value function is normally concave for gains, commonly convex for losses, and is generally steeper for losses than for gains. Decision weights are generally lower than the corresponding probabilities, except in the range of low probabilities. Overweighting of low probabilities may contribute to the attractiveness of both insurance and gambling.},

Both global and local models reveal that income and search queries are significant determinants to attraction demand, while distance from city centre is only significant in the global model. Visitor flow spillovers from neighbouring attractions are found to have significant effects on attraction demand. The intensity and direction of visitor flows’ spillover effects vary by attraction locations. Furthermore, asymmetric spillover effects of visitor flows between a pair of attractions have been identified for the first time in the tourism literature. The adoption of novel spatial estimation methods generates a new dimension to investigate intra-destination demand across attractions. This can provide empirical evidence for decision-makers to optimise visitor flows within a destination.},

Yet tourism collaboration in its pure form is rarely observed because destinations tend to be excludable and rivalrous. To better reflect this reality, the concept of coopetition has emerged. Coopetitive marketing, especially within the cross-border region at the macro level, is underdeveloped in tourism literature. This study assesses the prospect of developing a coopetitive brand of the Guangdong–Hong Kong–Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA), which spans geographical, political, ideological, and jurisdictional borders. Based on cross-sectional survey in six member cities in the GBA (N~=~2135), this study investigates homogeneity and heterogeneity of the cities' existing destination images, and identifies the effects of identity salience (residents and short- versus long-haul tourists) and of borders (SARs versus Mainland). Theoretically, this study consolidates the concept of coopetition and cross-border marketing in the light of different stakeholders' perceptions. The findings underpin the uniqueness of the member cities with unity in a possible common brand.},

We conduct an ABM simulation with a sample of 341 Chinese cities as destinations and 1,990 attractions to measure the degree of spillover between destinations by observing the frequency with which visitors traveling across destination boundaries visited attractions in other destinations. The simulation results demonstrate slightly different spillover effects based on visitor type and highlight three regions with particularly strong spillover effects: the Bohai Rim region, the Yangtze River Delta region, and the Sichuan and Chongqing region. These results appear consistent with those of exploratory spatial data analysis in a validation check. Lastly, policy implications are provided.},

First, the theoretical foundation for how tourism affects regional income inequality is discussed. Second, based on the conditional convergence framework, this study proposes a spatiotemporal autoregressive model to capture spatial and temporal dependence as well as spatial heterogeneity. Tourism development is introduced as a conditional convergence factor in an attempt to examine whether the convergence speed is accelerated by regional tourism development. Third, the effects of international and domestic tourism in narrowing regional inequality are compared both globally and locally. The empirical results indicate that tourism development contributes significantly to the reduction of regional inequality, with domestic tourism making a greater contribution than international tourism.},

Specifically, domestic tourism and inbound tourism play a significant role in stimulating local economic growth. However, the spatial spillover effect is limited to domestic tourism, and the spatial spillover effect of inbound tourism is not significant. Furthermore, the long-term effects are much greater than the short-term impact for both domestic and inbound tourism.

The short-term domestic tourism demand forecasts for 341 cities in China using panel data (pooled) models are compared with individual ordinary least squares (OLS) and naïve benchmark models. The pooled OLS model demonstrates much worse forecasting performance than the other models. This indicates the huge heterogeneity of tourism across cities in China. A marked improvement with the inclusion of fixed effects suggests that destination features that stay the same or vary very little over time can explain most of the heterogeneity. Adding spatial effects to the panel data models also increases forecasting accuracy, although the improvement is small. The spatial distribution of spillover effects is drawn on a map and a spatial pattern is recognized. Finally, when both spatial and temporal effects are taken into account, pooling improves forecasting performance.},

This paper reports results from an econometric study of tourism flows for the 107 Italian provinces based on origin–destination (OD) spatial interaction models. In addition to distance, the set of explanatory variables includes both pull and push characteristics to assess their relative roles in determining the attractiveness of the provinces to tourists. Hence measures are incorporated for income, density, accessibility, and natural, cultural and recreational attractions. The main results indicate the importance of spatial dependency induced by neighbouring provinces as both origins of, and destinations for trips, a factor commonly overlooked by previous contributions relying on the gravity specification. Inter-neighbouring interactive effects are thus important, and most explanatory variables exhibit the expected effect, with distance and population density showing a negative impact on tourists' decisions when choosing a specific destination, while income, accessibility and attractions are crucial determinants of tourism flows.},

The focus is on the creation of economic and social opportunity in small communities through the development of clusters of complementary firms that can collectively deliver a bundle of attributes to make up a specialized regional product. Micro-market clustering theory offers one alternative for enhancing regional economic growth, but it seems suited to tourism development when the regional product requires a combination of many services to deliver the single experience the tourist seeks.},

Next, the model utilizes tourist spot manager agents, whose responsibilities are alerting tourists about crowdedness and/or posting advertisements to attract tourists. A regional tourist flow model was developed to simulate the decisions and behaviors of these agents and predict tourist flow direction and distribution. The model was applied to the Sichuan province in China, which has 41 Class 3A and above tourism spots. Under different decision-making scenarios, the results of the model simulations showed that northwest, northeast, southeast, and southwest are the four main tourist flow directions and that crowd-alert would assist in effectively regulating tourist flow and tourism distribution patterns except when long-distance tourists dominate.},

  abstract = {Intergovernmental strategic interaction has been a particular focus of research on public economics. In China, the industrial land conveyance has gradually replaced fiscal, taxation, and population policies, and has become one of the most intense fields concerning the interaction between local governments. Based on panel data collected from 275 cities between 2007 and 2015, the researchers have constructed an asymmetric two-regime Spatial Durbin Model and conducted in-depth research into the strategic interaction between local governments in industrial land conveyance, from both regional and industry perspectives. The results show that industrial land conveyance in China’s different regions and industries demonstrate diversified interactive forms, as opposed to being limited to the ‘race-to-the-bottom’ form as is generally accepted by previous research. From a regional perspective, the nationwide data results show that the strategic interaction of local governments’ industrial land conveyance behaviors is featured by ‘strengthening intervention with a complete race-to-the-bottom strategy’. The authors then divided the data into three regional categories of eastern, central, and western, with the results showing that local governments compete to intervene in industrial land conveyance, and the degree of competitive intervention strengthens from east to west, with the eastern region being characterized by ‘no strategy’, the central region ‘strengthening intervention with a strengthening strategy when neighboring cities take a weakening strategy’, and the western region ‘strengthening intervention with a complete race-to-the-bottom strategy’. From an industrial perspective, compared with labor-intensive and technology-intensive industries that have an interactive form of ‘strengthening intervention with a follow-up strengthening strategy’, local governments’ competition to intervene in the industrial land conveyance is far fiercer in capital-intensive industries which have an interactive form of ‘strengthening intervention with a complete race-to-the-bottom strategy’.},

Design/methodology/approach Articles on tourism and hotel demand modeling and forecasting published mostly in both science citation index and social sciences citation index journals were identified and analyzed. Findings This review finds that the studies focused on hotel demand are relatively less than those on tourism demand. It is also observed that more and more studies have moved away from the aggregate tourism demand analysis, whereas disaggregate markets and niche products have attracted increasing attention. Some studies have gone beyond neoclassical economic theory to seek additional explanations of the dynamics of tourism and hotel demand, such as environmental factors, tourist online behavior and consumer confidence indicators, among others. More sophisticated techniques such as nonlinear smooth transition regression, mixed-frequency modeling technique and nonparametric singular spectrum analysis have also been introduced to this research area. Research limitations/implications The main limitation of this review is that the articles included in this study only cover the English literature. Future review of this kind should also include articles published in other languages. The review provides a useful guide for researchers who are interested in future research on tourism and hotel demand modeling and forecasting. Practical implications This review provides important suggestions and recommendations for improving the efficiency of tourism and hospitality management practices. Originality/value The value of this review is that it identifies the current trends in tourism and hotel demand modeling and forecasting research and points out future research directions.},

  abstract = {This study is concerned with the interrelated choices underlying a tourist's multi-destination behavior. A new destination choice model is developed based on the concept of future dependence, which argues that choice of a destination during a tour is influenced by choices of other destinations that will be visited later. The model is built within the universal (or mother) logit model framework and it is especially suitable to represent the choice behavior with many destinations, which are difficult to represent using a traditional nested logit model. The results of analysis empirically confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed modeling approach, using questionnaire survey data collected in Tottori Prefecture, Japan in 2007. It was also revealed that travel time, diversity of destination, and variety-seeking remarkably affect the multi-destination choice behavior.},

  abstract = {This paper analyzes the subsequent decisions of tourists with respect to sequential destinations: why they visit a given destination after visiting a previous one and where they are most likely to go. Using a dataset from an on-site tourist survey in Nanjing, China, we study this decision process by partitioning it into three stages, and a nested logit model is used to estimate the determinants in each stage. Apart from the individual characteristics of tourists and destination attributes, we find that the spatial configuration of destinations (spatial structure) also tends to influence tourists’ destination choice. Finally, a series of simulations are carried out to understand the competition/substitution patterns between subsequent destinations.},

  abstract = {The main purpose of this research is to investigate and estimate the spillover effects in inbound and domestic tourism flows to 341 cities in mainland China. In conjunction with this, the key determinants of tourism flows are also studied in the spatial econometric model. The results confirm the existence of spillover effects in both inbound and domestic tourism flows, and suggest that physical infrastructure factors, tourist attractions, and the SARS outbreak are significant determinants of inbound and domestic tourism flows. In addition, it is found that although the degree of openness to inbound tourists is important for inbound tourism flows, a city?s income is the key to enhancing domestic tourism flows. Significant differences in spillover effects and determinants of tourism flows are also discovered between cities in different regions.},

  abstract = {This study examines two types of spatial effects in regional tourism growth: spatial spill-over and spatial heterogeneity. A spatial growth regression framework is used to model the growth in regional tourism and identify the economic and spatial factors that explain the variability in tourism growth across 342 prefectural-level cities in China from 2002 to 2010. The analysis identifies several important factors, including local economic growth, localization economies, tourism resource endowments, and hotel infrastructure, as well as spatial spill-over effects and cross-city competition effects associated with tourism resource endowments and hotel infrastructure. A geographically weighted spatial Durbin model is then used to account for spatial heterogeneity in tourism growth patterns, and localized patterns of tourism growth are identified.},
