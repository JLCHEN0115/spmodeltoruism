  abstract = {This research proposes a two-regime spatial Durbin model with spatial and time-period fixed effects to test for political yardstick competition and exclude any other explanation that might produce spatial interaction effects among the dependent variable, the independent variables, or the error term. The study also derives the maximum likelihood estimator and variance–covariance matrix of the parameters of this model. Data pertaining to welfare spending by 93 departments in France during 1992–2000 provide significant empirical evidence in support of political yardstick competition. Departments governed by a small political majority mimic neighboring expenditures on welfare to a greater extent than do departments governed by a large political majority.},

  abstract = {We argue that identification problems bedevil applied spatial economic research. Spatial econometrics usually solves these problems by deriving estimators assuming that functional forms are known and by using model comparison techniques to let the data choose between competing specifications. We argue that in many situations of interest this achieves, at best, only very weak identification. Worse, in many cases, such an approach will be uninformative about the causal economic processes at work, rendering much applied spatial econometric research “pointless,” unless the main aim is description of the data. We advocate an alternative approach based on the “experimentalist paradigm” which puts issues of identification and causality at center stage.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we extend the GMM framework for the estimation of the mixedregressive spatial autoregressive model by Lee (2007a) to estimate a high order mixed-regressive spatial autoregressive model with spatial autoregressive disturbances. Identification of such a general model is considered. The GMM approach has computational advantage over the conventional ML method. The proposed GMM estimators are shown to be consistent and asymptotically normal. The best GMM estimator is derived, within the class of GMM estimators based on linear and quadratic moment conditions of the disturbances. The best GMM estimator is asymptotically as efficient as the ML estimator under normality, more efficient than the QML estimator otherwise, and is efficient relative to the G2SLS estimator.},
